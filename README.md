# Biostatistics Signal Processing

This code is an introduction to statistical calculations and signal processing in MATLAB 

# Description
Part 1 of this code uses existing data to determine correlations between various biometrics.  
Part 2 of this code records and processing audio signals. It shows various types of filtering as well as a validity check by adding noise and filtering it out  

# Getting Started
The file can be run as is but the data loaded in lines 9-11 can be swapped out or added to with the supplementary .csv files.  
Ensure you have a working microphone, as part 2 requires the user to speak into a microphone to record the audio
